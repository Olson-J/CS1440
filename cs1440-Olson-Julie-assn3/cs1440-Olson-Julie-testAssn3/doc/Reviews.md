I really like how you did the layout of your design, it looks a lot more clear than how I did mine because it’s easy to see where the program starts from. I also really like that you used color for the class boxes, it makes it a bit more interesting to look at. Both the color and the layout helps the reader stay focused and not gloss over any important information. If I had to suggest any changes to your design I would suggest lowering all of the text boxes explaining how the classes interact with each other. Right now they are right on top of the lines connecting everything and it’s a little bit hard to read. Other than that the only thing I can think of is to maybe fill up some of the blank space you have? You could use bigger boxes and fonts without having to change the positioning of everything too much, and it would help with readability. The way you separated the info in the boxes by private and public looks really nice, but I think you might be missing some data members (like __m_currentDeck and __m_menu in the UI class) and static members (like COLUMN_NAMES in the Card class). I might have misunderstood what exactly we are supposed to include on the UMLs honestly, or maybe you got rid of them in your code and don’t need them anymore, but I thought I’d mention it. Overall this looks great, you did a really good job!

I like that your UML file is very straightforward, each class shown is clearly labeled. I do think you might be missing the menu and menuOptions classes, unless you somehow got rid of them. I know most people haven’t really changed much in either of them but I do think they are supposed to be included in the diagram even if they are the same as they were in the pseudocode. The relationships between the classes are clear, and I like that you included the possible ranges for each arrow. I am a little confused as to why the arrow between the RandGen and Card classes says ‘is used’ and points to the Card class instead of saying ‘used’ with the arrow pointing towards the RandGen class like the other arrows do. Most of the functions and data classes are present and labeled, except for RandGen which I would have thought would have more things in it. I’m not sure where exactly, but somewhere there was an explanation (on Discord maybe?) that specified functions like __str__ that have two underscores on both sides become public, and would only be private if they had the double underscores on one side. I think we are also supposed to include static members in the classes (like COLUMN_NAMES in the Card class or MIN_SIZE and MAX_SIZE in the RandGen class), unless you got rid of them and didn’t use any static values. All in all it is clear to read and is not confusing to read, but I would double check that you aren’t missing any information that might get you docked points for not including.

### Review from Murf
Hey Julie, 

Great job with this UML diagram, it is super simple to follow and has a great amount of information. I definitely learned a thing or two from this! Also, great job including the creates and uses connections between each class. The arrows are pointing in the correct direction and allow for an easy flow. One item that I did notice is that the "RandNumbers" class should be named "RanNumberSet", this isn't too big of a deal, but something to consider when writing your code. Additionally, he mentioned in one of his lectures that we can change the variable naming conventions as needed, I didn't do this either, but it's something to keep in mind as you go on. I was a little confused with your Menu class and how some of the operations are labeled. For example, with the "__iadd__" function, I'm not completely sure why the self is on the outside of the parenthesizes. This might simply be something that I missed within one of the lectures, if so let me know. As far as I can tell all of the functions and attributes are returning the proper format of data. Something that could be fairly simple to change, that would help with the reading of the information, would be to widen each class table, that way you don't have the funky work wrap causing a separation into two lines.

Seriously, great job with this UML! It was hard for me to find things to comment on, so I started to get picky :)

### Review from Kaden Hart

From this, I can see that you have decided to go with six classes as were given in the pseudo code. I can see that User-interface uses Menu and that menu uses the menu option. I can also tell that UserInterface also Creates A deck object which uses the card object which uses the randnumberset. With your diagram, it is clear to see the flow of information and command. I think that it is a very clear UML diagram. I will say, however, that If the user interface creates the Deck Object then doesn't the deck also create the card objects? Also, you didn't label the possible amount range on each side of the dotted arrows. EX: 1 Deck ----> 0-8192 Cards. Your UML diagram clearly describes what functions are public and private. I would recommend that you also do the same for the variables, I am not sure if we are supposed to but it couldn't hurt.
You also label what type of data is returned in each function, is used/stored in each variable, and the data types in the parameters. I think this was very thorough. I can tell that your UserInterface prompts the user using the menu and menu option class. I can also tell that The User Interface uses the deck class to get data about the card in order to print it. I assume based on the diagram that it gets the instruction to do so via user input as they interact with the menu. Overall I think it is a great UML diagram.
